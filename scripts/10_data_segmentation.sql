Data Segmentation Analysis
===============================================================================
This script groups products and customers into simple business segments.

The goal is to make the data easier to analyze by creating categories based on
product cost and customer behavior. These segments can help identify product
price ranges and different types of customers according to their purchase history.

Main SQL concepts used:
    - CASE to create custom groups
    - COUNT() to count records in each segment
    - SUM() to calculate customer spending
    - DATEDIFF() to calculate customer lifespan
    - GROUP BY to summarize results by segment
